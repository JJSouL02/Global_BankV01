# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Banking Integration

This project combines a tic-tac-toe game with basic banking functionalities. You can play tic-tac-toe while managing a bank account.

## Project Contents

The project consists of three main files:

### 1. `bank_v02.py`

This file contains the core of the banking application. It allows creating new accounts, logging into existing accounts, and performing operations like checking balance, depositing, withdrawing money, changing passwords, and viewing transaction history.

### 2. `Cuenta.py`

Here, the `Cuenta` class is defined, representing a bank account. It provides methods to manage the account, such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, changing passwords, and viewing transaction history.

### 3. `tictactoe.py`

This file contains the tic-tac-toe game (`TicTacToe`). Two players can play on the classic tic-tac-toe board. It also integrates with the banking system, allowing players to manage a bank account while playing.
